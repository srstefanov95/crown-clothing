This is an e-commerce clothing application that I developed alongside an [React online course in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

This project includes the following technologies:
- React as the main library
- Redux for state management
- Redux Thunk for asynchronous external requests and promises
- Redux Sagas
- React Hooks
- Redux Persist for local and session storage
- React Router for routing
- Firebase for authentication and data storage
- Stripe for test payments
- Styled components for SCSS styling in JS
- Media queries for responsive design
- React Lazy for code splitting and performance optimization
- Included manifest and service-worker to ensure that the application is a PWA
